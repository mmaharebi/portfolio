## Introduction

One of the most elegant connections in quantum physics is the bridge between the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) and quantum optics. The mathematical framework we use to describe a simple mass on a spring reappears, almost unchanged, when we describe light at the quantum level.

> **TL;DR** — The *same* operators that raise and lower energy levels in the quantum harmonic oscillator become photon creation and annihilation operators when you quantize a mode of the electromagnetic field. The mathematics stays identical—only the physical interpretation changes.

## 1. The Quantum Harmonic Oscillator and Ladder Operators

### The Starting Point

The one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) describes a particle bound by a quadratic potential. Its Hamiltonian is:

$$
\hat H=\frac{\hat p^2}{2m}+\frac12 m\omega^2 \hat x^2
$$

This looks messy, but we can simplify it dramatically by introducing **ladder operators**.

### Defining the Ladder Operators

We define two special operators, $\hat a$ (lowering) and $\hat a^\dagger$ (raising):

$$
\hat a=\sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{2\hbar}}\!\left(\hat x+\frac{i}{m\omega}\hat p\right),\qquad
\hat a^\dagger=\sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{2\hbar}}\!\left(\hat x-\frac{i}{m\omega}\hat p\right)
$$

These operators satisfy the fundamental **canonical commutation relation**:

$$
[\hat a,\hat a^\dagger]=1
$$

### The Elegant Result

With these operators, the Hamiltonian takes a remarkably simple form:

$$
\hat H=\hbar\omega\!\left(\hat a^\dagger \hat a+\tfrac12\right)
$$

The operator $\hat n=\hat a^\dagger\hat a$ is called the **number operator**, and it has eigenstates $|n\rangle$ with eigenvalues $n$:

$$
\hat n|n\rangle=n|n\rangle
$$

We can build all energy eigenstates from the ground state $|0\rangle$ by repeatedly applying the creation operator:

$$
|n\rangle=\frac{(\hat a^\dagger)^n}{\sqrt{n!}}\,|0\rangle,\qquad \hat a|0\rangle=0
$$

### How the Ladder Operators Act

These operators "climb" the energy ladder by adding or removing quanta:

$$
\hat a|n\rangle=\sqrt{n}\,|n-1\rangle,\qquad
\hat a^\dagger|n\rangle=\sqrt{n+1}\,|n+1\rangle
$$

The names "lowering" and "raising" operators come from this behavior—they literally lower or raise the quantum number by one.

## 2. Quantized Light: Oscillators Become Photons

### The Same Mathematics, New Physics

Here's where the magic happens: when we quantize the electromagnetic field, a single mode (with frequency $\omega$) has the **exact same Hamiltonian** as the quantum harmonic oscillator:

$$
\hat H_{\text{field}}=\hbar\omega\!\left(\hat a^\dagger \hat a+\tfrac12\right)
$$

The mathematics is identical, but the **physical interpretation** transforms completely:

| Operator | QHO Interpretation | Quantum Optics Interpretation |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| $\hat a$ | Lowers energy by $\hbar\omega$ | **Annihilates a photon** |
| $\hat a^\dagger$ | Raises energy by $\hbar\omega$ | **Creates a photon** |
| $\vert n\rangle$ | Energy eigenstate | **Fock state** with $n$ photons |
| $[\hat a,\hat a^\dagger]=1$ | Canonical commutation | **Same algebra**, different meaning |

### Why This Works

In quantum field theory, we decompose the electromagnetic field into independent modes (like Fourier modes). Each mode oscillates at a specific frequency, just like a harmonic oscillator. When we quantize the field, these oscillations become quantized—and the quanta are photons.

The ladder operators of the QHO **become** the photon creation and annihilation operators. The "particle" that gets created or destroyed is no longer a material particle on a spring—it's a quantum of the electromagnetic field itself.

## 3. The Complete Electromagnetic Field

### Many Modes, Many Oscillators

A single mode is just the beginning. The full electromagnetic field contains infinitely many modes, each characterized by:
- A wavevector $\mathbf{k}$ (direction and wavelength)
- A polarization state
- A frequency $\omega_k = c|\mathbf{k}|$

The complete Hamiltonian is a sum over all these independent modes:

$$
\hat H=\sum_k \hbar\omega_k\!\left(\hat a_k^\dagger \hat a_k+\tfrac12\right)
$$

Each mode has its own pair of creation and annihilation operators, and they satisfy:

$$
[\hat a_k,\hat a_{k'}^\dagger]=\delta_{kk'}
$$

This means operators from different modes **commute**—each mode behaves like an independent quantum harmonic oscillator. The electromagnetic field is essentially an infinite collection of independent oscillators, one for each possible mode.

## 4. Quadratures, Coherent States, and Quantum Measurements

### Field Quadratures: Phase Space for Light

Just as the harmonic oscillator has position and momentum, the electromagnetic field has analogous observables called **quadratures**:

$$
\hat X=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat a+\hat a^\dagger),\qquad
\hat P=\frac{1}{i\sqrt{2}}(\hat a-\hat a^\dagger)
$$

These satisfy the canonical commutation relation:

$$
[\hat X,\hat P]=i
$$

Think of $\hat X$ and $\hat P$ as the "position" and "momentum" of the field mode—they define a phase space for light, with the same quantum uncertainty as mechanical systems.

### Coherent States: The Quantum Description of Laser Light

**Coherent states** $|\alpha\rangle$ are eigenstates of the annihilation operator:

$$
\hat a|\alpha\rangle=\alpha|\alpha\rangle
$$

These special states have remarkable properties:

- They **minimize uncertainty**: $\Delta X \cdot \Delta P = 1/2$ (the quantum limit)
- They're the **closest quantum analog** to classical electromagnetic waves
- They describe **laser light** in quantum optics
- The photon number follows a **Poissonian distribution** with mean $\bar n=|\alpha|^2$

Coherent states are essentially the ground state of the oscillator, displaced in phase space to some complex amplitude $\alpha$.

### Squeezed States: Redistributing Quantum Noise

**Squeezed states** are even more exotic. They redistribute uncertainty between the two quadratures:

- Reduce noise in $\hat X$ at the expense of increased noise in $\hat P$ (or vice versa)
- Still respect the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\Delta X \cdot \Delta P \geq 1/2$
- Enable **quantum-enhanced measurements** beyond the standard quantum limit
- Used in gravitational wave detectors (LIGO) and precision metrology

All these concepts—quadratures, coherent states, squeezed states—are just **relabelings** of the QHO's phase-space picture, now applied to the quantum electromagnetic field.

## 5. The Big Picture: Same Mathematics, Different Physics

### A Side-by-Side Comparison

The table below summarizes the beautiful correspondence between the QHO and quantum optics:

| Mathematical Object | QHO Interpretation | Quantum Optics Interpretation |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| $[\hat a,\hat a^\dagger]=1$ | Canonical ladder algebra | Photon creation/annihilation algebra |
| $\hat n=\hat a^\dagger\hat a$ | Energy quantum number | Photon number operator |
| $\hat X,\hat P$ | Scaled position/momentum | Electric and magnetic field quadratures |
| $\|n\rangle$ | $n$-th energy eigenstate | Fock state with exactly $n$ photons |
| $\|\alpha\rangle$ | Displaced ground state | Coherent state (laser light) |

### The Key Insight

**Quantization maps each electromagnetic field mode to a harmonic oscillator.** The mathematical structure is preserved completely:

- The ladder operators remain ladder operators
- The commutation relations stay the same
- The energy spectrum has the same structure

What changes is **what the operators act on**:
- In the QHO: a particle in a potential
- In quantum optics: the electromagnetic field itself

The bridge between these theories is **purely algebraic**. The physics—the actual observable phenomena—is in the **interpretation** of these operators, not in their mathematical properties.

This is one of the most profound examples of mathematical unification in physics: the same abstract structure describes both mechanical oscillations and the quantum nature of light.

## Appendix: Mathematical Reference

### Number (Fock) States

The number basis forms the foundation of quantum optics:

$$
\langle n|\hat a^\dagger \hat a|n\rangle=n,\qquad
\hat a|0\rangle=0
$$

The vacuum state $|0\rangle$ is annihilated by $\hat a$, and has zero photons but non-zero energy $E_0 = \hbar\omega/2$ (vacuum energy).

### Coherent State Expansion

A coherent state can be expanded in the Fock basis:

$$
|\alpha\rangle=e^{-|\alpha|^2/2}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\alpha^n}{\sqrt{n!}}\,|n\rangle
$$

The expected photon number in this state is:

$$
\langle \hat n \rangle_{|\alpha\rangle}=|\alpha|^2
$$

This shows that the amplitude $\alpha$ directly relates to the intensity of the light (since intensity is proportional to photon number).

### Squeezing Operator

The single-mode squeezing operator is defined as:

$$
\hat S(\zeta)=\exp\!\left[\tfrac12(\zeta^\ast \hat a^2-\zeta\,\hat a^{\dagger 2})\right],\quad \zeta=re^{i\phi}
$$

where $r$ is the squeezing parameter and $\phi$ determines the squeezing angle. Applying this operator to the vacuum state produces a squeezed vacuum state, which has reduced noise in one quadrature at the expense of increased noise in the conjugate quadrature.
