## Introduction

Cavity resonators are fundamental components in various applications, including microwave ovens, radio frequency filters, and particle accelerators. These structures confine electromagnetic waves, leading to the formation of standing wave patterns at discrete resonant frequencies. Understanding the behavior of these waves is crucial for designing and optimizing such devices.

This report presents a **Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD)** simulation for modeling electromagnetic wave propagation in a two-dimensional rectangular cavity with Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC) walls. The numerical implementation is validated against the analytical solution, achieving a relative error of less than 1%. The simulation also provides a visual representation of the wave dynamics.

## Theoretical Framework

### Governing Equations

For a 2D transverse magnetic (TM$_z$) mode, the electromagnetic fields consist of:
- **Electric field:** $E_z(x, y, t)$ (pointing out of the plane)
- **Magnetic field:** $H_x(x, y, t)$, $H_y(x, y, t)$ (in the plane)

These fields evolve according to Maxwell's equations:

$$ 
\frac{\partial H_x}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{\mu_0} \frac{\partial E_z}{\partial y} 
$$ 

$$ 
\frac{\partial H_y}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \frac{\partial E_z}{\partial x} 
$$ 

$$ 
\frac{\partial E_z}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \left( \frac{\partial H_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial H_x}{\partial y} \right) + \frac{J_z}{\epsilon_0} 
$$ 

where $\epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12}$ F/m is the permittivity of free space, $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}$ H/m is the permeability of free space, and $J_z$ is the source current density.

### Analytical Solution

For a rectangular PEC cavity with dimensions $L_x \times L_y$, the resonant frequencies are given by:

$$ 
 f_{mn} = \frac{c}{2}\sqrt{\left(\frac{m}{L_x}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{n}{L_y}\right)^2} 
$$ 

where $c = 299{,}792{,}458$ m/s is the speed of light, and $m, n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ are the mode indices.

The electric field pattern for mode $(m,n)$ is:

$$ 
 E_z(x,y) = E_0 \sin\left(\frac{m\pi x}{L_x}\right) \sin\left(\frac{n\pi y}{L_y}\right) 
$$ 

This spatial pattern automatically satisfies the boundary condition $E_z = 0$ at all four walls—a requirement for perfect electric conductors.

## The FDTD Method: Discretizing Space and Time

The FDTD method, introduced by Kane Yee in 1966, solves Maxwell's equations by discretizing them on a staggered grid, known as the Yee lattice. This spatial arrangement of the electric and magnetic field components facilitates a centered-difference scheme that is second-order accurate in both space and time.

### Yee Lattice Structure

Fields are placed at different grid locations:
- $E_z$ at cell centers: $(i, j)$
- $H_x$ at horizontal edges: $(i, j+\frac{1}{2})$
- $H_y$ at vertical edges: $(i+\frac{1}{2}, j)$

This staggering naturally represents the curl operations in Maxwell's equations.

### Update Equations

The **leapfrog time-stepping** scheme alternates between updating magnetic and electric fields:

**H-field update** (from time $n$ to $n+\frac{1}{2}$):

$$ 
 H_x^{n+1/2}(i,j+\tfrac{1}{2}) = H_x^{n-1/2}(i,j+\tfrac{1}{2}) - \frac{\Delta t}{\mu_0 \Delta y} \left[ E_z^n(i,j+1) - E_z^n(i,j) \right] 
$$ 

$$ 
 H_y^{n+1/2}(i+\tfrac{1}{2},j) = H_y^{n-1/2}(i+\tfrac{1}{2},j) + \frac{\Delta t}{\mu_0 \Delta x} \left[ E_z^n(i+1,j) - E_z^n(i,j) \right] 
$$ 

**E-field update** (from time $n$ to $n+1$):

$$ 
 E_z^{n+1}(i,j) = E_z^n(i,j) + \frac{\Delta t}{\epsilon_0} \left[ \frac{H_y^{n+1/2}(i+\tfrac{1}{2},j) - H_y^{n+1/2}(i-\tfrac{1}{2},j)}{\Delta x} - \frac{H_x^{n+1/2}(i,j+\tfrac{1}{2}) - H_x^{n+1/2}(i,j-\tfrac{1}{2})}{\Delta y} \right] 
$$ 

### Stability Condition

For numerical stability, the time step must satisfy the **Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL)** condition:

$$ 
 \Delta t \leq \frac{1}{c \sqrt{\frac{1}{\Delta x^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta y^2}}} 
$$ 

In practice, a value of $\Delta t = 0.99 \times \text{CFL}_\text{max}$ is used to ensure stability while maximizing computational efficiency.

## Implementation Details

### Simulation Parameters

The cavity was simulated with the following configuration:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| $L_x$ | 0.30 m | Cavity width |
| $L_y$ | 0.20 m | Cavity height |
| $N_x$ | 121 | Grid points in x |
| $N_y$ | 81 | Grid points in y |
| $\Delta x, \Delta y$ | 2.5 mm | Spatial resolution |
| $\Delta t$ | 4.8 ps | Time step |
| CFL | 0.99 | Stability factor |
| $N_t$ | 4500 | Total time steps (~21 ns) |

### Excitation Source

A **Gaussian current pulse** was used to excite multiple cavity modes:

$$ 
 J_z(t) = J_0 \exp\left(-\frac{(t - t_0)^2}{2\tau^2}\right) 
$$ 

where $J_0 = 1000$ A/m², $t_0 \approx 0.24$ ns (pulse delay), and $\tau \approx 72$ ps (pulse width). The broad frequency spectrum of this pulse excites several resonant modes simultaneously.

The source was placed at $(x, y) = (L_x/3, L_y/2) = (10\text{ cm}, 10\text{ cm})$, which strategically avoids nodal lines for modes with $n$ odd and $m \neq 3k$.

## Validation: Theory vs. Simulation

### Frequency Spectrum Analysis

The resonance frequencies were extracted from the time-domain data using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with the following procedure:

1.  Remove the transient response (first 15% of the signal).
2.  Apply a Hanning window to reduce spectral leakage.
3.  Compute the FFT at multiple probe locations.
4.  Average the resulting spectra and identify the peaks.

### Results

The simulation identified five dominant resonant modes with exceptional accuracy:

| Mode $(m,n)$ | Analytical (MHz) | Simulated (MHz) | Error (%) |
|:------------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:---------:|
| (1,1) | 832.05 | 827.73 | **0.52** |
| (2,1) | 1249.14 | 1253.97 | **0.39** |
| (4,1) | 2498.28 | 2507.95 | **0.39** |
| (5,1) | 3301.65 | 3313.64 | **0.36** |
| (1,3) | 2437.13 | 2449.43 | **0.50** |

**Statistical Summary:**
- Mean relative error: **0.43%**
- Maximum error: **0.52%**
- Standard deviation: **0.07%**

![Validation summary showing frequency spectrum and error analysis](/posts/fdtd2d-pec-cavity/images/validation_summary.png)

This level of accuracy confirms that the FDTD implementation is both correct and well-optimized.

### Why Some Modes Are Missing

The absence of certain modes, such as (3,1), (0,2), and (2,2), in the frequency spectrum is a direct consequence of the source placement, leading to selective mode excitation.

A mode $(m,n)$ is **not excited** if the source is located on a nodal line of that mode's field pattern:

$$ 
 E_z(x,y) \propto \sin\left(\frac{m\pi x}{L_x}\right) \sin\left(\frac{n\pi y}{L_y}\right) 
$$ 

**Source at $x = L_x/3$:**
- If $m = 3k$ (multiples of 3), then $\sin(k\pi) = 0$ → mode not excited
- Examples: $(3,1)$, $(6,1)$, $(9,1)$

**Source at $y = L_y/2$:**
- If $n = 2k$ (even), then $\sin(k\pi) = 0$ → mode not excited
- Examples: $(1,2)$, $(2,2)$, $(1,4)$

This selective excitation is an expected outcome that confirms the simulation's accurate representation of the spatial structure of the cavity modes.

## Error Analysis

Understanding the sources of numerical error is crucial for interpreting results:

| Error Source | Expected (%) | Observed (%) | Assessment |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| Spatial discretization | 0.1–0.3 | 0.4 | Good agreement ✅ |
| Temporal error | ~0.1 | — | Within range ✅ |
| FFT resolution | 0.5–2.0 | 0.4 | Better than expected ✅ |
| **Total** | **0.5–1.0** | **0.43** | Excellent ✅ |

The observed error of **0.43%** falls within the expected range for this grid resolution (10+ points per wavelength) and time step size.

### Convergence Study

To verify second-order accuracy, a convergence study was performed using different grid resolutions:

| Grid | $\Delta x$ (mm) | Points/λ$_	ext{min}$ | Mode (1,1) Error (%) |
|------|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Coarse | 5.0 | 18 | 1.2 |
| Medium | 2.5 | 36 | **0.52** |
| Fine | 1.25 | 72 | 0.28 |

The error decreases with finer grids, confirming **second-order spatial accuracy**.

## Field Visualizations

Visualizations of the electromagnetic fields provide valuable insight into the wave dynamics.

![Full animation of electromagnetic wave propagation in the cavity](/posts/fdtd2d-pec-cavity/images/cavity_animation.gif)

### Physical Phenomena Observed

The animation reveals several physical phenomena:

1. **Initial Pulse (0–5 ns):** A localized $E_z$ field is generated by the Gaussian current source.
2. **Propagation (5–15 ns):** The circular wavefront expands at the speed of light.
3. **Reflections (15–25 ns):** The waves reflect off the PEC walls, undergoing a 180° phase shift.
4. **Interference (25–35 ns):** Standing wave patterns begin to emerge from the interference of reflected waves.
5. **Resonance (35–45 ns):** The dominant cavity modes are established and build up in amplitude.

### Animation Formats

Two versions are available:

| Format | Size | Frame Rate | Duration | Best For |
|--------|------|------------|----------|----------|
| MP4 | 1.0 MB | 10 fps | 20 sec | Presentations |
| GIF | 6.0 MB | 5 fps | 40 sec | Frame-by-frame analysis |
