This is your first blog post with **MDX** and **KaTeX** support!

## Features

This blog supports:

1. **Markdown** formatting (bold, italic, lists, etc.)
2. **Mathematical equations** with KaTeX
3. **GitHub Flavored Markdown** (tables, strikethrough, etc.)
4. **Organized assets** - Each post has its own `images/`, `files/`, and `assets/` folders

## Asset Organization

You can now organize your post content with:

- **Images**: `./images/` - Add screenshots, diagrams, photos
- **Files**: `./files/` - Share code, datasets, PDFs
- **Assets**: `./assets/` - Videos, design files, etc.

Reference them with relative paths:
```markdown
![My Image](./images/example.jpg)
[Download Code](./files/script.m)
```

## Math Examples

### Inline Math

The famous equation by Einstein: $E = mc^2$

The Pythagorean theorem states that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ for right triangles.

### Display Math

The quadratic formula:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

Euler's identity, one of the most beautiful equations:

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

An integral:

$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

## Code Example

```javascript
function calculateQuadratic(a, b, c) {
  const discriminant = b * b - 4 * a * c;
  const x1 = (-b + Math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a);
  const x2 = (-b - Math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a);
  return [x1, x2];
}
```

## Table Example

## Conclusion

You now have a fully functional blog with MDX and KaTeX support! 🚀

Create more posts by adding `.mdx` files to the `content/posts/` directory.

**New Structure**: Each post now has its own folder:
```
content/posts/[post-slug]/
  ├── index.mdx
  ├── images/
  ├── files/
  └── assets/
```
